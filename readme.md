# React Chatbot ðŸ’¬

A simple chatbot built using React (based on SuperSimpleDev's tutorial).  
I focused on understanding **state, props, event handling**, and **component structure**.

## Features
- User and bot messages
- Loading animation while waiting for response
- Auto-scroll and clean UI

## Learnings
This project helped me understand how React manages re-renders and event-driven communication between components.
